public class HelloWorld {                         // here it defines a public class of HelloWorld that matches the name of the java file
    public static void main(String[] args){       // here main is the name of the method which is the entry point for our code when running java
                                                  // passing in a name of String[] is the type of things being passed in called args-- args is going to be type of string
                                                  // the void word signifies that it's not expecting  something to return
        System.out.println("Hello, Danny!");      // here we print out to the console using the -System.out.println- followed by whatever is being printed to console in () surronded by qutations
    }                                             // when using the println after the args(the text inside the paranthesis) it adds an extra line space after the output text
}                                                 // when using the print it doesn't add an extra line space after the output text.
